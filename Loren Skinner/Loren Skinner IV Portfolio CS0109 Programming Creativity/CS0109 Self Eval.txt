I thouroughly enjoyed this class, and I would
say this is the course I put the most work into
out of all of my courses this semester. The
classwork was fun and engaging and I rarely felt
like I was ever "working" for this class. I feel
my work was reflective of my engagement in this
class, both of which very high. All in all,
this was a fantastic class to learn in, and I
hope I will take more classes like it in the future!

Thank you Lee for teaching a fantastic class! I look
forward to "What Computers Can't Do" next semester
with you, and you are high on my list of professors
for a Div II committee! I don't feel there is much I
need to elaborate on in terms of an evaluation,
although I should warn you not to expect any of the
projects in the "Other Projects" folder to run, and
if they do, they likely do not do what was expected
of them. Most of them are failed experiments as I
was learning to work in Processing.
